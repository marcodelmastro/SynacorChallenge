# Synacor Challenge

## Notes

* Virtual machine implementation was relatively simple, self test at beginning helped quite a lot debugging
* A text adventure!
* After some wondering around I found the can of oil for the lantern, and reach the ruins where I found the red coin (two dots) and this numerical (?) puzzle:

_ _ + _ * _^2 + _^3 - _ = 399 _

## Codes

Code 1: iwAXllQmiZDv (it was in the instructions!)
Code 2: XstgJSxeHSHA (first simple run of the VM)
Code 3: IhBRSqeTnzgw (after self test)
Code 4: XEBwBmFKDmLA (using tablet)

## ChangeLog

* 2021-02-24: 
  * Implemented basic virtual machine and status saving mechanism. 
  * Added saving of VM status and command list to track/repeat progress.
  * Found first 4 codes
